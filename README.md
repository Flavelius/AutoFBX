Exports and fbx alongside the saved file using export presets from the fbx exporter

Export presets can be created by opending the fbx export dialog.
After that, one can be set in the addon panel (3D View -> AutoFBX sidepanel entry; use reload when presets have changed)
if enabled is ticked an fbx is saved with the same filename alongside the original blend, 
alternatively the 'export' button can be used to manually do that
